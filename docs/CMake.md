# CMake Configuration

The CMake configuration for this project is heavily borrowed from [HSF Training](https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cmake-webpage/06-projectstructure/index.html)

For integrating ImGui as a CMake project, ideas from [imgui-cmake](https://github.com/Pesc0/imgui-cmake) were used.
