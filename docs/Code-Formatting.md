# Code Formatting

This project uses `clang-format` to format C++ code. The `clang-format` VS code extension by xaver is used with `formatOnSave = true` to format the files automatically.

To use the VS code extension with the repository's `.clang-format` style definition, ensure the C++ style flag is set to `file`.
